## Part 3 – TimescaleDB Evaluation 

TimescaleDB is a PostgreSQL-based system designed for time-series data. It introduces hypertables, which break data into time-based parts, making it easier and faster to query large datasets. This is helpful in knowledge bases that track data changes over time.

Another feature is continuous aggregates. This allows automatic updating of summary views as new data comes in. TimescaleDB also includes compression and data tiering, which help save storage space and reduce costs.

It supports standard SQL and PostgreSQL tools, which makes it easier for developers to adopt. Its real-time data processing is also useful for knowledge bases that require quick responses.

The main limitation is that TimescaleDB is focused on time-series data. For knowledge bases that rely more on complex relationships, another system may be needed. Also, setting up features like continuous aggregates may require extra effort and system resources.

In summary, TimescaleDB is a strong option when the knowledge base includes time-focused data and needs fast, scalable queries.
