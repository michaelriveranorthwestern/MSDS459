## Part 2 – Gel (EdgeDB) Evaluation

Gel, formerly known as EdgeDB, is a new open-source database system built on PostgreSQL. It combines features from relational and graph databases, making it suitable for knowledge bases that require modeling complex relationships. One main feature is the graph-relational model, which replaces traditional SQL joins with objects and links. This makes data connections easier to understand and manage.

EdgeQL is Gel’s custom query language. It supports deep queries with simple syntax, which helps when working with data that spans many layers. Another feature is Gel’s built-in AI tools, including automatic embedding generation and a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) endpoint. These features support integration with language models and intelligent search.

Gel also has a built-in authentication system with support for OAuth, email/password, and passkeys. Developer tools like a schema browser, data editor, and visual query builder improve usability.

However, Gel has some disadvantages. It requires learning a new data modeling approach and query language. Because it is a newer system, there is less documentation and fewer community resources. Also, migration from traditional databases could take time and effort.

In conclusion, Gel offers strong capabilities for building knowledge bases, especially for complex and AI-driven applications. But teams must be prepared for the learning curve and migration work.
