## Part 5 – pgvector with Python and Go

pgvector adds vector search to PostgreSQL, making it possible to store and compare embeddings such as those from text or images. It supports similarity metrics like cosine similarity, inner product, and Euclidean distance. This helps build AI-powered search features in knowledge bases.

For Python developers, pgvector works with tools like Django, SQLAlchemy, and Psycopg2. For Go developers, pgvector-go supports pgx, GORM, and sqlx. This makes it easy to use vector data in both languages.

A major benefit is that vector and relational data can be stored together in one database. This reduces system complexity. It also runs on PostgreSQL, which is a reliable and mature platform. Supporting both Python and Go also gives teams flexibility.

However, pgvector may not be as fast as dedicated vector databases for large-scale use. Also, setting up good indexes (like HNSW or IVFFlat) can be complex. As a newer tool, its support community is still growing.

In summary, pgvector is a practical choice for integrating vector search into PostgreSQL, especially when using Python or Go. Teams should plan for setup complexity if the use case involves high performance.
