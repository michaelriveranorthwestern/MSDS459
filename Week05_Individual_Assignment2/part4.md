## Part 4 – ParadeDB Evaluation 
ParadeDB is a PostgreSQL extension that adds advanced search and analytics features. It offers performance similar to Elasticsearch but works fully inside PostgreSQL. One of its key features is full-text search using the BM25 algorithm. The pg_search tool improves search quality and speed, especially on large datasets.

ParadeDB also supports hybrid search, combining full-text search with vector similarity using pgvector. This enables semantic search, which is helpful for AI-powered knowledge bases. It also includes real-time indexing so changes to data are immediately searchable.

Another feature is external data access. With pg_lakehouse, ParadeDB can query data stored in services like Amazon S3 or Google Cloud Storage without importing it first.

ParadeDB has many benefits, including unified data management and fast, flexible search. However, it requires setup experience, especially when working with extensions. Its AGPLv3 license may also limit commercial use. Since it is new, community support is still growing.

In conclusion, ParadeDB is a powerful tool for knowledge bases needing advanced search. Teams should consider setup complexity and licensing when adopting it.
