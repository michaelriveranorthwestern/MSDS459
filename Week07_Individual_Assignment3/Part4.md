# Part 4: Using Technical Analysis

Technical analysis uses charts and price history to predict how a stock might move in the short term. It doesn’t look at the company itself but instead studies patterns like highs, lows, and volume. People who use this method look for trends or signals that say when to buy or sell. It’s fast and works well with recent data, but it doesn’t explain why a stock is moving. In term projects, students could use technical analysis by tracking price data and adding it to a knowledge graph. For example, they could link a stock’s moving average with tweets or news to build models that predict price behavior.

## Key Takeaways
1. Technical analysis looks at stock prices and trends, not company details.
2. It’s useful for timing trades but ignores long-term value.
3. Students can connect chart data to investor behavior or news.
