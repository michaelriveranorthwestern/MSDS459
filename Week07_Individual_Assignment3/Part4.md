# Part 4: Using Technical Analysis

Technical analysis uses charts and historical price data to predict how a stock might move in the short term. It does not examine the company’s fundamentals but instead focuses on patterns in price movements, trading volume, and momentum indicators. This method helps identify trends and signals that suggest when to buy or sell. It is fast and works well with recent data but does not explain the reasons behind a stock's movement. In the context of this project, technical analysis can be used by tracking price data and incorporating it into a knowledge graph. For example, moving averages can be linked with tweets or news headlines to build models that help predict price behavior.

## Key Takeaways
1. Technical analysis looks at stock prices and trends, not company details.
2. It’s useful for timing trades but ignores long-term value.
3. Chart data can be connected to investor behavior or market sentiment.
