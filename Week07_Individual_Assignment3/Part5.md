# Part 5: Using Sentiment Analysis

Sentiment analysis checks text—like news articles, social media posts, or company reviews—to find out if people feel positive, negative, or neutral. In investing, it helps measure how people feel about a company or market. It’s fast and useful for early signals, but it can get confused by sarcasm or slang and may need cleaning. In the term project, students could collect and label tweets or headlines, then connect those to stock movements. They could use a knowledge graph to link public mood with trading decisions or price trends.

## Key Takeaways
1. Sentiment analysis checks if opinions in text are positive, negative, or neutral.
2. It offers fast insight from unstructured sources like news or social media.
3. Students can link opinions to price movement in their projects.
