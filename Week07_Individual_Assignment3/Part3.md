# Part 3: Using Fundamental Analysis

Fundamental analysis means studying a company’s financial and economic data to understand its real value. This can include profits, debt, industry trends, and company leadership. Investors use it to decide if a stock is undervalued or overvalued. It is useful for long-term decisions because it looks at the company’s real strengths. But it takes time, depends on good data, and may miss short-term market movements. In class projects, students can use this analysis by linking financial facts in a knowledge graph. For example, students could connect earnings reports, economic data, and management history to help predict investment performance.

## Key Takeaways
1. Fundamental analysis studies company data to estimate true value.
2. It helps with long-term investing but may miss short-term shifts.
3. Students can use it to build graphs connecting financial facts.
