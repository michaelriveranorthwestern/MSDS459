# Part 1 (20 points)

**Provide a summary of the assigned readings from the *Knowledge Graphs* textbook for Week 1. Identify three or more key ideas from these readings, citing relevant online resources.**

The Week 1 readings help us understand what knowledge graphs are and why they matter. They explain why knowledge graphs were created, how they have changed over time, and how they are built. Chapters 1 and 2 show how knowledge graphs are different from older ways of organizing data, and they describe how we can model them using networks and clear rules to represent meaning and relationships.

## Key Ideas

### What a Knowledge Graph Is
A knowledge graph is a way to organize information about real-world things, like people, places, or events, and how they are connected. It looks like a network or a web, where each item is a point (called a node), and the connections between them are lines (called edges). What makes knowledge graphs powerful is that they don’t just store facts, they also capture the meaning behind those facts. Because of this, they’re useful for things like helping search engines understand what you’re looking for, recommending products or movies, or answering complex questions.

### How Information Is Stored in a Knowledge Graph
Knowledge graphs store facts in sets of three parts: a starting point, a connection type, and an endpoint. For example, *Paris - is the capital of - France* would be one of these three-part facts. These facts are all linked together to form a big network. To make sure every item is clearly identified (so we know which Paris we mean), each one is given a special unique name, sort of like a digital ID. This makes it possible to connect data from many different places without confusion.

### Why Meaning and Structure Matter
To make sure the information in a knowledge graph is meaningful and organized, developers use tools that define the kinds of things in the graph and how they relate to each other. These tools act like a blueprint or a guidebook. For example, they can define that a person can have a birthplace, or that a book has an author. This helps computers understand the structure of the data and even make smart guesses or answer questions based on it. Without these tools, the graph would just be a bunch of random facts without clear meaning.
