# Week 3 Individual Assignment - Repository Overview
This repository contains a five-part set of summaries and key ideas drawn from assigned readings on Knowledge Graphs and Natural Language Processing (NLP), prepared as part of a foundational course in AI and data systems.

## Contents

- **Part 1:** Summary of Chapters 1–2 from *Knowledge Graphs: Fundamentals, Techniques, and Applications*. Introduces the concept of knowledge graphs, how they differ from traditional data structures, and how they model real-world entities and relationships.
  
- **Part 2:** Summary of Chapters 3 and 5 from the same textbook. Discusses how to identify relevant domains for a knowledge graph and how to extract information from web sources for graph construction.

- **Part 3:** Summary of Chapter 4, focusing on Named Entity Recognition (NER) as a foundational step in building knowledge graphs, including rule-based, statistical, and neural methods for identifying entities.

- **Part 4:** Summary of Chapter 1 from *Natural Language Processing in Action (2nd ed.)*, which gives a high-level introduction to NLP, covering language pipelines, understanding vs. generation, and the ethical implications of NLP applications.

- **Part 5:** Summary of Chapter 11 from the same NLP textbook, exploring how NLP methods support information extraction and knowledge graph construction, including grounding language models, structured fact generation, and comparing rule-based vs. machine learning approaches.
