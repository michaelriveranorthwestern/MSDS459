# Part 2 (20 points)

**Provide a summary of the assigned readings from the *Knowledge Graphs* textbook for Week 2. Identify three or more key ideas from these readings, citing relevant online resources.**

The Week 2 readings focus on two important parts of building knowledge graphs: figuring out what topic area the graph should cover (Chapter 3) and pulling information from websites to fill in the graph (Chapter 5). Together, these chapters show how to gather the right knowledge from different kinds of sources so that the graph can answer smart questions and support deeper understanding.

## Key Ideas

### Finding the Right Domain for the Knowledge Graph
Chapter 3 explains how to discover the topic area, or "domain," that the knowledge graph will focus on. This is done by analyzing large sets of documents to spot patterns, themes, and common topics. The authors describe different ways to group similar information and find useful terms and ideas. These help shape the structure of the graph so that it makes sense in a specific context, like health care or sports.

### Collecting Information from the Web Automatically
Chapter 5 talks about how to get useful facts from websites without having to do it all by hand. The authors explain how systems can learn to pull structured information, like names, dates, or places, from pages that follow common patterns, such as tables or lists. These methods reduce the amount of human work needed and help fill in the knowledge graph more quickly. Still, the web often has messy or confusing data, so it’s important to clean and match the information correctly.

### Using Website Structure to Help Build the Graph
Both chapters show how the layout and design of websites—like menus, links, and tables—can help systems understand how different pieces of information are connected. This structure makes it easier to scale up the process of building knowledge graphs. The authors mention tools that can automatically learn how to extract data by comparing similar pages, which speeds things up and improves accuracy.
