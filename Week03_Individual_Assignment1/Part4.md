# Part 4 (20 points)

**Provide a summary of the assigned readings from *Natural Language Processing in Action* for Week 1. Identify three or more key ideas from these readings, citing relevant online resources.**

This chapter introduces natural language processing or NLP, which is the science of teaching machines to read, understand, and write in human language. It explains that NLP plays a key role in modern artificial intelligence by allowing machines to do things we usually think only people can do, like chatting, answering questions, summarizing information, and even persuading someone. The chapter also lays out basic concepts like how machines understand language, how they produce it, and how NLP systems are built step by step.

## Key Ideas

### NLP Systems Work in Steps, Like a Pipeline
NLP systems don’t process language all at once, they go through a series of steps, like breaking up sentences into words, figuring out grammar, and turning text into numbers the computer can understand. These steps form a pipeline. Older systems used rules written by people to do this, but newer systems use large amounts of data and learning algorithms to do it better. This helps with real-world tasks like spotting emotion in a review, searching by meaning instead of exact words, or chatting with a custom...

### Understanding and Producing Language Are Two Core Skills
The chapter explains that NLP has two big parts. One is understanding what people write or say, and the other is producing text that sounds natural. Understanding involves turning words into numbers so the computer can recognize topics, answer questions, or find similar meanings. Producing language means taking those ideas and turning them into readable sentences. Together, these skills help machines act more like human conversation partners, writers, or assistants.

### NLP Can Be Helpful or Harmful, So Ethics Matter
The authors remind us that while NLP can be very useful, like in virtual therapy or educational tools, it also comes with risks. It can be used to mislead people, invade privacy, or repeat harmful biases if not carefully designed. This is why it’s important for people who build these systems to think about how their work affects others and to make sure it’s used in fair and responsible ways.
