# Part 5 (20 points)

**Provide a summary of the assigned readings from *Natural Language Processing in Action* for Week 2. Identify three or more key ideas from these readings, citing relevant online resources.**

Chapter 11 explains how we can turn plain language into structured facts that computers can understand. The chapter shows how tools in natural language processing can be used to build knowledge graphs, networks of information that help machines reason, explain, and make better decisions. The chapter also compares different methods for breaking down language and talks about the importance of linking artificial intelligence tools to trusted facts.

## Key Ideas

### Turning Text into Structured Facts
The chapter describes a step-by-step process that takes written text and turns it into a structured format, like a knowledge graph. First, the system finds names of people, places, and things. Then, it connects words like she or her to the correct person. After that, it figures out how words relate in a sentence, like who did what to whom. Finally, it takes all this information and creates a set of facts, like "Timnit Gebru works at Google." These facts become part of a network that the computer can unde...

### Connecting AI to Real-World Facts
The authors explain that large language models (like the ones that power chatbots) can sometimes make things up. To fix this, we can ground them using knowledge graphs. This means tying what the model says back to verified facts. Doing this makes the system more trustworthy and helps people trace where the information came from. It also lets machines do things like commonsense reasoning and fact-checking, which are important in real-world applications.

### Choosing Between Rules and Learning Models
The chapter compares two ways to break down and understand text. One way uses simple rules, like patterns to find dates or names. This approach is fast and easy to understand, but not very flexible. The other way uses machine learning, which can handle different types of language and adapt better, but it's slower and harder to explain. In practice, a combination of both methods often works best. For example, using a rule to find a phone number and a learning model to understand a sentence.
